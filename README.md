# vidshare
Vidshare is a distributed application that allows people to share create collaborative video playlists and share videos with each other remotely, as well as storing their personal favorite videos in a database. Users can use the Youtube Data API to search for videos on the application, and then add videos to their personal standby, which they then confirm to share with other clients of the application. The server application then combines the submitted standby playlists to make an overall “Collective Standby” list that is shared amongst clients, so they can share their viewing experience.
